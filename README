BACKGROUND
This script was made in a hurry by me to fix my play counts in Banshee.
Importing my iPod music library to Banshee worked out nicely, only a lot of
play counts were not correctly imported.


USEAGE
The iTunes database is stored in the library path and is called: "iTunes Music
Library.xml", check your iTunes preferences to find out where it exactly is.
The Banshee database is a sqlite file located in "~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db"
Copy over these to files to the script directory rename and itunes library file
to "Library.xml" and open it up in a text editor. Open up this file in a text
editor and replace all the <integer> and <date> tag pairs with <string>. So
<integer> becomes <string> and </integer> becomes </string>. The same goes for
date.

Run the script.
Copy the banshee.db back to its original location, make sure you make a backup
of your orginal database.

This script worked for me but might require some changes for others. Feel free
to make modifications.
